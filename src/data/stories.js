                        <p>A sense of vulnerability, a feeling of loneliness, a perpetuated sensation to belong because you feel as though you do not have a recognized place in the world.&nbsp; It causes one to seek out an outlet for their anxieties...often to the extent of destruction. It&rsquo;s a game that kills the hunter and the hunted; a fairytale that ends in absolute tragedy.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;Krad was no fool. He knew that already.</p>
                        <p>He knew that it was impossible; that you would never be interested in him. He knew of the strange anatomy that bounded the two of you apart, though he tried not to dwell on fact. He was all too aware of the small infatuation you held for that disgusting redhead; as he knew everything else. But despite the self-absorbed anguish he dealt with day by day, he found himself oddly wanting more. The obsession he had grown for you was far too strong and was threatening to take over his homicidal sanity entirely.</p>
                        <p>It all started about a month ago.</p>`,

You were in no need of hurrying, but felt the need to get someone&rsquo;s attention immediately, before <em>he</em> could catch up with you. Your fists clenched at the thought, your stomach twisted at the very vision of him entering the vicinity....</p>
                        <p><em>Because if you allowed him to touch you again. If you allowed him to snap the very fabric of your sanity that had just been amended...</em></p>
                        <p>It had only been an accident, you told yourself, over and over again. He didn&rsquo;t mean to do it, he was just playing. It was all some kind of sick joke that the juniors played of fresh meat. Yes, that was it. The light touches, the provocative glances, all of those were just tricks that boys played with girls when they were bored and wanted something to do. Even when his lips accidentally collided up against yours, even when his tongue accidentally slithered into the cavern of your mouth, he was just joking.</p>
                        <p>But you knew it what all a lie, and he knew it too.</p>

Ever since that little incident in the hallway last month you had began sporting this erratic behavior, jumping in and out of consciousness, always staring off into space when you were in the middle of a conversation. He knew he was to blame for this, he had theorized that you were confused and probably needed a bit of consoling. If only he could better self-control he could&rsquo;ve protected you from all of this mess, he could&rsquo;ve-</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I heard Daisuke Niwa asked you out.&rdquo; You queried quietly, hoping to spark some conversation.</p>
                        <p>Risa giggled, looking down at the frills in her skirt with added thoughtfulness, &ldquo;Yeah, but I turned him down....It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s cute he&rsquo;s just...&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Not your type?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;The most important feature in a guy is that he has to be cool!&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Has to be cool, huh?&rdquo; you muttered and Risa grumbled angrily beside you. &ldquo;Risa you set your values to high...&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>You sighed; shoving the large algebra books in your locker as you finally leaned against the wall. &ldquo;I think we should talk to the SCA about these schedule changes,&rdquo; you mumbled, breathing lightly.</p>
                        <p>Risa stared at you calmly, and then, for moment, her eyes shone with something brand new. &ldquo;What about you (Name)?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Has anyone asked you out yet? Don&rsquo;t lie to me! (Name)! You have to tell me or I&rsquo;ll find out myself!</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Well- uh....&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>You couldn&rsquo;t understand why Risa was so bent up on your love life. Nothing ever extraordinary happened to you, nor will anything every will. You will continue to live your life alone. Because it&rsquo;s easier, because it&rsquo;s safer.</p>
                        <p><em>Click</em></p>
                        <p>You froze. A brush of blue grazed your cheeks as you automatically turned to see a familiar smiling keenly at you.</p>
                        <p><em>Satoshi pulled back, or more like fell back. All the sensations he had been feeling were gone. The confusion and anger he had been releasing on you had faded away like the grains of sand in the wind.</em></p>

                        <p><em>It was when you said his name that he realized that he wasn&rsquo;t in love with you. He never would be.</em></p>

                        <p><em>It&rsquo;s impossible to force change. </em></p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I..I don&rsquo;t know understand.&rdquo; You murmured lowly, eyes casted downward,</p>
                        <p>You could feel the heat stirring as Satoshi approached you. His fingers skimmed lithely across your face, running back and forth through your scalp as his eyes fluttered to a half-lidded state, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re shivering.&rdquo; He noted.</p>
                        <p>You stood frozen, unable to speak with his skin contacting with yours. Life had taken an unexpected turn, and now things were headed for the worst.&nbsp;</p>`,
